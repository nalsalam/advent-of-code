## Regolith Reservoir 

(We return to this on day 17)

Step 1

Read puzzle input and use it to fill in the rock walls.

Step 2

Let the sand fall, move diagonaly left, move diagonally right, to find a resting spot

At some point no more resting spots are left and the sand falls into the abys.

*How many units of sand come to rest before sand starts flowing into the abyss below?*

In the example 24 units of sand fall and come to rest. No more can after that.
